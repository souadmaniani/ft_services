# Supervisor: A Process Control System
# supervisordâ€˜s primary purpose is to create 
# and manage processes based on data in its 
# configuration file. It does this by creating
# subprocesses. Each subprocess spawned by supervisor
# is managed for the entirety of its lifetime by 
# supervisord (supervisord is the parent process
# of each process it creates). When a child dies,
# supervisor is notified of its death via the 
# SIGCHLD signal, and it performs the appropriate operation.
